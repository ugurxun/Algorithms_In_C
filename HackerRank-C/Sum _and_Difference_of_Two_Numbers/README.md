# **Task**

Your task is to take two numbers of int data type, two numbers of float data type as input and output their sum:

1. Declare **4** variables: two of type int and two of type float.
2. Read **2** lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the 'Input Format' section below) and initialize your **4** variables.
3. Use the  and  operator to perform the following operations:
    * Print the sum and difference of two int variable on a new line.
    * Print the sum and difference of two float variable rounded to one decimal place on a new line.

# **Input Format**

The first line contains two integers.
The second line contains two floating point numbers.

# **Constraints**

* 1 ≤ integer variables ≤ 10⁴
* 1 ≤ float variables ≤ 10⁴

# **Output Format**

Print the sum and difference of both integers separated by a space on the first line, and the sum and difference of both float (scaled to **1** decimal place) separated by a space on the second line.

## **Sample Input**
```
10 4
4.0 2.0
```
## **Sample Output**
```
14 6
6.0 2.0
```

# **Explanation**

When we sum the integers **10** and **4** , we get the integer **14** . When we subtract the second number **4** from the first number **10** , we get **6** as their difference. When we sum the floating-point numbers **4.0** and **2.0**, we get **6.0**. When we subtract the second number **2.0** from the first number **4.0**, we get **2.0** as their difference.
