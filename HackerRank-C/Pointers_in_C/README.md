# **Task**

Complete the function void update(int *a,int *b). It receives two integer pointers, int* a and int* b. Set the value of a to their sum, and b to their absolute difference. There is no return value, and no return statement is needed.
 * a' = a + b
 * b' = |a - b|

# **Input Format**

The input will contain two integers, a and b, separated by a newline.

# **Output Format**

Modify the two values in place and the code stub main() will print their values.

Note: Input/ouput will be automatically handled. You only have to complete the function described in the 'task' section.

## **Sample Input**
```
4
5
```
## **Sample Output**
```
9
1
```
# **Explanation**
 * a' = 4 + 5 = 9
 * b' = |4 - 5| = 1
